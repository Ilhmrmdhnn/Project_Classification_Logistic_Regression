# Gender Classification Analysis Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on gender classification using Logistic Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. The aim is to develop a model that can accurately predict the gender of individuals based on various features.

## Key Features
1. Data Collection:
* Gathering a comprehensive dataset containing features such as age, height, weight, and other relevant attributes.
* Ensuring the dataset includes balanced representation of both genders.

2. Data Preprocessing:
* Handling missing values and outliers.
* Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with gender.
* Visualizing data using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify trends and patterns.

4. Model Development:
* Implementing Logistic Regression for gender classification.
* Training the model on the dataset and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

5. Model Evaluation:
* Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Performing cross-validation to ensure model robustness and reliability.

6. Visualization:
* Creating visualizations to present model performance and insights.
* Using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization.
